The Geometry Dash-facing backend for RealistikGDPS.

**Note that this branch does not work at this moment. Please use the `stable` branch for deployments.**

This is **just** the backend. For more functionality, consult the full [deployment](https://github.com/RealistikGDPS/deployment).


## Requirements
While Docker should handle all of this, in cases where you are running this standalone, here are the requirements:
### Software and Hardware
- Python 3.12 (we are leveraging new language features).
