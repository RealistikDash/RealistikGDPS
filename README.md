The Geometry Dash-facing backend for RealistikGDPS.

## What is this?
This is essentially the service with which the Geometry Dash client communicates directly. It is responsible for
handling requests directly from the Geometry Dash client and returning responses in the format the client expects.

This is **just** the backend. For more functionality, consult the full [deployment](https://github.com/RealistikGDPS/deployment).
